        <p class="jupiter-moon-tit-des">There are 95 moons of Jupiter with confirmed orbits as of 23 March 2023.[1][note 1] This number does not include a number of meter-sized moonlets thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes.[4] All together, Jupiter's moons form a satellite system called the Jovian system. <br><br> The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun.</p>

            <h1 class="abt-tit">About Jupiter's Moons</h1>
            <p class="abt-des">By most counts, Jupiter has between 80 and 95 moons, but neither number captures the complexity of the Jovian system of moons, rings and asteroids. The giant planet commands thousands of small objects in its orbit. Scientists are getting so good at spotting tiny moons orbiting distant, giant planets that the International Astronomical Union has decided the smallest will no longer be given mythological names unless they are of “significant” scientific interest. <br><br>

                Jupiter's four largest moons were the first moons discovered beyond Earth. They are called the Galilean satellites after Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who first observed them in 1610. The German astronomer Simon Marius claimed to have seen the moons around the same time, but he did not publish his observations and so Galileo is credited with their discovery. <br> <br> <br>Four more innermost moons are the the source of the dust that makes up Jupiter’s four faint rings. The rest of Jupiter's moons orbit much farther out from the planet. The larger moons may be captured asteroids and the smaller ones are likely fragments from massive collisions.
            <ul class="ul-jup-des"><li>o is the most volcanically active world in the solar system, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains dozens of miles (or kilometers) high.</li>
            <li>Europa is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and an ocean of salty water that may be one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth in our solar system.</li>
            <li>Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system and the only moon with its own magnetic field.</li>
            <li>Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in our solar system.</li>

                <p class="jupiter-moon-des">Ganymede, or Jupiter III, is the largest and most massive natural satellite of Jupiter as well as in the Solar System, being a planetary-mass moon. It is the largest Solar System object without an atmosphere, despite being the only moon of the Solar System with a magnetic field. Like Titan, it is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than Mercury, Io or the Moon. <br>
                    Ganymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.[17][18][19][20] Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of it. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.[8] Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively. </p>

                <p style="position: relative;left: -10em;"+ class="jupiter-moon-des">Europa  or Jupiter II, is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 95 known moons of Jupiter. It is also the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei[1] and was named (by Marius) after Europa, the Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter). <br><br>

                    Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust[14] and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its white-beige surface is striated by light tan cracks and streaks, but craters are relatively few. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s. In September 2022, the Juno spacecraft flew within about 320km (200 miles) of Europa for a more recent close-up view. </p>
