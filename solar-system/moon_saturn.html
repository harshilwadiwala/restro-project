        The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets
        only tens of meters across to the enormous Titan, which is larger than
        the planet Mercury. There are 146 moons with confirmed orbits.[1][a]
        This number does not include the many thousands of moonlets embedded
        within Saturn's dense rings, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized
        distant moons that were seen through telescopes but not recaptured.
        <br /><br />Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed
        into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those,
        Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Three
        moons are particularly notable.

      <h1 class="abt-tit-sat">About Saturn's Moons</h1>
      <p class="abt-des-sat">
        Of the known moons, 24 are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits
        not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane.[8] They include the
        seven major satellites, four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit
        with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons, and two moons that act
        as shepherds of Saturn's narrow F Ring. Two other known regular
        satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large
        Hyperion is locked in an orbital resonance with Titan. The remaining
        regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the dense A Ring, within the
        diffuse G Ring, and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The
        regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses
        or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. <br /><br />

        The remaining 122, with mean diameters ranging from 2 to 213 km (1 to
        132 mi), are irregular satellites, whose orbits are much farther from
        Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and
        retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or
        fragments from the collisional breakup of such bodies after they were
        captured, creating collisional families. Saturn is expected to have
        around 150 irregular satellites larger than 2.8 km (1.7 mi) in diameter,
        plus many hundreds more that are even smaller. <br /><br />The irregular
        satellites are classified by their orbital characteristics into the
        prograde Inuit and Gallic groups and the large retrograde Norse group,
        and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies (with the
        Gallic group corresponding to Celtic mythology). The sole exception is
        Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn and largest irregular one, discovered
        at the end of the 19th century; it is part of the Norse group but named
        for a Greek Titaness.

          Mimas, also designated Saturn I, is a natural satellite of Saturn that
          has the second largest crater on any moon in the Solar System, named
          Herschel. The Herschel crater measures 139 kilometres (86 miles)
          across, about one-third of Mimas's mean diameter (396.4 kilometres or
          246.3 miles),[10] and is believed to be formed from an extremely
          energetic impact event. The crater's name is derived from the
          discoverer of Mimas, William Herschel, in 1789. <br />
          Mimas is the smallest astronomical body known to be roughly rounded in
          shape due to its own gravity. Mimas's low density, 1.15 g/cm3,
          indicates that it is composed mostly of water ice with only a small
          amount of rock. The moon's presence has created one of the largest
          'gaps' in Saturn's ring, named the Cassini Division, due to orbital
          resonance destabilizing the particles' orbit there.

          Rhea (/ˈriː.ə/) is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the
          ninth-largest moon in the Solar System, with a surface area that is
          compareable to the area of Australia. It is the smallest body in the
          Solar System for which precise measurements have confirmed a shape
          consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.[11] It was discovered in 1672
          by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Rhea was discovered by Giovanni Domenico
          Cassini on 23 December 1672.[1] It was the second moon of Saturn that
          Cassini discovered, and the third moon discovered around Saturn
          overall. <br /><br />

          Rhea is named after the Titan Rhea of Greek mythology, the "mother of
          the gods" and wife of Kronos, the Greek counterpart of the god Saturn.
          It is also designated Saturn V (being the fifth major moon going
          outward from the planet, after Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, and
          Dione).[12][13] Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys,
          Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus) Sidera Lodoicea (the stars of Louis) to
          honor King Louis XIV.[1] Astronomers fell into the habit of referring
          to them and Titan as Saturn I through Saturn V.[1] Once Mimas and
          Enceladus were discovered, in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended
          to Saturn VII, and then to Saturn VIII with the discovery of Hyperion
          in 1848.
