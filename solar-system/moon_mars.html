      <p class="main-mars-moon-des">
        The two moons of Mars are Phobos and Deimos.[1] They are irregular in
        shape.[2] Both were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in
        August 1877[3] and are named after the Greek mythological twin
        characters Phobos (fear and panic) and Deimos (terror and dread) who
        accompanied their father Ares into battle. Ares, god of war, was known
        to the Romans as Mars. <br />
        <br />
        Compared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small.
        Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08×1016 kg,
        while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0×1015
        kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km
        (5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits
        farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital
        period of 30.35 hours.

        Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. Both are believed to be captured
        asteroids.

      <h1 class="phobos-head">1. Phobos</h1>
      <img src="phobo_mars.jpg" alt="" class="phobos-img" />
      <p class="phobos-des">
        Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons. It orbits Mars three times a
        day, and is so close to the planet's surface that in some locations on
        Mars it cannot always be seen. Phobos is nearing Mars at a rate of six
        feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years. At that rate, it will either
        crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring.
        <br /><br />
        Phobos is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km
        (7 mi).[5] Phobos orbits 6,000 km (3,700 mi) from the Martian surface,
        closer to its primary body than any other known planetary moon. It
        orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates and completes an orbit in just
        7 hours and 39 minutes.[9] As a result, from the surface of Mars it
        appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15
        minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day.

      <p class="Deimos-des">
        Deimos is the smaller of Mars' two moons. It orbits Mars whirls around
        Mars every 30 hours.Deimos was discovered by Asaph Hall III at the
        United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., on 12 August 1877,
        at about 07:48 UTC.[a] Hall, who also discovered Phobos shortly
        afterwards, had been specifically searching for Martian moons at the
        time. <br /><br />

        The moon is named after Deimos, a figure representing dread in Greek
        mythology.[10] The name was suggested by academic Henry Madan, who drew
        from Book XV of the Iliad, where Ares (the Roman god Mars) summons Dread
        (Deimos) and Fear (Phobos).
